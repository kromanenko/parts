Stock headlight adjustment in Aprilia Pegaso 650 i.e. requires the spanner 
(8 mm) and much luck to catch and turn bolt head several times under fairing.
Set this cap on bolt and adjust headlight manually without spanner.
This part better to print with longitudinal direction of layers.
Possible matherials: ABS, Plastan etc.
STL file for 3d-printing included.
